# slack-yap-bot

Learning to build a Slack Bot, and implement it in dbt-llm-tools project so that the user can ask for the data within the slack instead of current streamlit interface


# rough procedure : 
 1. intialise the bot with the "app.py" to have the basic actions like replying to your "hello" message.
 2. make a ".env" file in the same directory as the "app.py" to save the token and the signing key.
